As promised, here's a guide to help you and your husband discuss your family's insurance needs together!

**Decision Checklist for Couples:**

‚úì What are our biggest worries if something unexpected happens?
‚úì How would we manage financially if one of us couldn't work?
‚úì What coverage do we already have? (employer, existing policies)
‚úì What gaps do we need to fill before baby arrives?
‚úì Can we afford $440/month comfortably? (that's $14.50/day)
‚úì What would happen if we don't have maternity coverage?

**Real Story from a Young Family Like Yours:**

"My husband and I were also hesitant about the cost at first. But when our baby arrived 3 weeks early with complications, our AIA policy covered $22,000 in medical bills. We paid $0 out of pocket. Best decision we ever made."
- Michelle & David, Parents to baby Ethan

**Questions to Discuss:**
1. If delivery costs $20K+ out of pocket, where would we get that money?
2. If I (Sarah) couldn't work after pregnancy complications, how long could we manage on one income?
3. What happens to our baby financially if something happens to one of us?

**Remember:** You don't have to decide everything tonight. Start the conversation, see how you both feel, and Rachel or I are here to answer any questions that come up!

As you enter your second trimester, it's time to start thinking about delivery day - not just baby names and nursery colors, but also the practical stuff like insurance!

- They'll verify coverage instantly

Step 2: Direct Billing Setup
- Hospital bills AIA directly
- You won't pay anything upfront (up to $25K covered)
- Only extras (room upgrades, special meals) need payment

Step 3: After Delivery

                body: `Hi Sarah,

Hope you're settling into the wonderful chaos of new parenthood! Baby Emma is so lucky to have you.

As promised, I wanted to reach out about education planning. I know Emma is only a few weeks old, but starting early makes all the difference!

**The Reality Check:**

By the time Emma turns 18 (in 2044):
- Local university: ~$150,000
- Overseas university: $300,000+
- Private education (K-12): Additional $200,000

**The Good News:**

If you start saving now, you only need $150/month to build a $150,000 education fund by the time Emma is 18!

**How It Works:**

AIA Education Endowment Plan:
- Save $150/month for 18 years
- Guaranteed returns + bonuses
- Money available when Emma starts university
- Built-in protection: If anything happens to you, premiums are waived AND Emma still gets the full amount

**Real Example:**

Pay in: $150 x 12 months x 18 years = $32,400
Get back: $150,000+ (guaranteed!)

That's your $32K turning into $150K+ for Emma's education.

**Why Start Now?**

‚úì Lower monthly cost (time is on your side!)
‚úì Compounding returns over 18 years
‚úì Protection built-in
‚úì Locked-in rates (no price increases)
‚úì Tax benefits

**Next Step:**

I'd love to show you a personalized illustration based on Emma's birth date. Can we schedule a quick 20-minute call next week? I'll walk you through the numbers and answer all your questions.

Just reply with a few time options that work for you!

Warmly,
Rachel Tan
